Hippo Hack - hackathon for your students!
Hi $0$,

My name is Michael and I am a junior at the Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. I am a founder of Enginuity Tech, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that offers students free STEM classes and organizes local hackathons in the Massachusetts area for all students of any programming expertise. This year we are hosting Hippo Hack, a free, in-person hackathon hosted here in Massachusetts for all students in grades 6-12 with an interest in the field of computer science. Would it be possible to pass along the following message along with the flyer to your students in an email or in class?


Create a team with your friends to join in on a day full of hacking and compete over the course of 14 hours for prizes! Hippo Hack is a free, in-person hackathon hosted here in Massachusetts for all students in grades 6-12 who have interest in computer science and want to show their creativity and learn more in computer science. Free concessions and meals will be given out! If you are interested in participating, please check out hippohack.org.


Thanks so much for your help!
Michael Zhang
