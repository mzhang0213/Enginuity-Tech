Hippo Hack Sponsorship Inquiry
Hi $0$,

My name is Michael, and I am a junior at the Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. I am a founder of Enginuity Tech, a nonprofit organization that offers students free STEM classes and organizes local hackathons in the Massachusetts area for all students of any programming expertise. This year we are hosting Hippo Hack, a free, in-person hackathon hosted here in Massachusetts for all students in grades 6-12 interested in computer science. Students will work in groups and broaden their skills while employing their creativity to create a one-of-a-kind project! We are interested in whether you could help sponsor us for this yearâ€™s Hippo Hack as well as many other tech-related events in the future! For additional details regarding sponsorship, refer to the attached prospectus.

Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Michael Zhang
