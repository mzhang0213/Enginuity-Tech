Hippo Hack Sponsorship Inquiry
Dear $0$,

My name is Michael, and I am a junior at the Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. I am a founder of Enginuity Tech, and we are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that plans to offer students free STEM classes during the summer and organize local hackathons in the Massachusetts area for all students of any programming expertise. This year we are hosting Hippo Hack, a free, in-person hackathon hosted here in Massachusetts for all students in grades 6-12 interested in computer science. Students will work in groups and broaden their skills while employing their creativity to create a one-of-a-kind project! We are interested in whether you could help sponsor us for this year’s Hippo Hack as well as many other tech-related events in the future! For additional details regarding sponsorship, refer to the attached prospectus. Additionally, you can find our website at hippohack.org!

Your help would be greatly appreciated and it will contribute to the education of a new generation in one of today’s most prevalent fields of study.

Sincerely,
Michael Zhang
