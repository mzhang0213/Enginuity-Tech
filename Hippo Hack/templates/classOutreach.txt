Summer CS Class Opportunity for your students!
Hi $0$,

My name is Michael and I am a junior at the Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. I am a founder of Enginuity Tech, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that offers students free STEM classes and organizes local hackathons in the Massachusetts area for all students of any programming expertise. This year we are hosting Hippo Hack, a free, in-person hackathon hosted here in Massachusetts for all students in grades 6-12 with an interest in the field of computer science. Would it be possible to pass along the following message along with the flyer to your students in an email or in class?

Enginuity Tech is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded by high schoolers in Massachusetts. With the summer coming up, their summer term is also starting soon! Enginuity Tech is dedicated to offering students better education in fields of STEM and computer science. They offer free, engaging classes taught by qualified students who have excelled in the subjects they teach. For more information, visit bit.ly/enginuitytech!

Thanks so much for your help!
Michael Zhang
